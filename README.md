# Node.js highly scalable architecture
Node MVC pattern, application and its development are divided into three interconnected parts. The advantage of this is it helps in focusing on a specific part of the application name, the ways information is presented to and accepted from, the user. It helps in allowing for efficient code reuse and the parallel development of the application. Even if the project structure might look a little different than an ideal MVC structure, the basic program flow in and out the application remains the same.

# What you'll get in this architecture:
1) Node.js Using Express.js
2) Parsing Requests & Sending Responses
3) Rendering HTML Dynamically (on the Server)
4) Working with Files and generating PDFs on the Server (on-the-fly)
5) File Upload and Download
6) Using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern
7) Using Node.js with SQL (MySQL) using Sequelize
8) Using Node.js with NoSQL (MongoDB) using Mongoose
9) Working with Sessions & Cookies
10) User Authentication and Authorization
11) Sending E-Mails
12) Validating User Input
13) Data Pagination
14) Handling Payments with Stripe.js
15) Building REST APIs
16) Authentication in REST APIs
17) xFile Upload in REST APIs
18) Building GraphQL APIs
19) Authentication in GraphQL APIs
20) File Upload in GraphQL APIs
21) Building a Realtime Node.js App with Websockets
22) Automated Testing (Unit Tests)
23) Deploying a Node.js Application
24) Using TypeScript with Node.js
25) Highly scalable folder architecture
