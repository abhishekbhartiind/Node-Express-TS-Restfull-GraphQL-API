# Node-highly-scalable-architecture
Node MVC pattern, application and its development are divided into three interconnected parts. The advantage of this is it helps in focusing on a specific part of the application name, the ways information is presented to and accepted from, the user. It helps in allowing for efficient code reuse and the parallel development of the application. Even if the project structure might look a little different than an ideal MVC structure, the basic program flow in and out the application remains the same.
